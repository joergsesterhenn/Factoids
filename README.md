# Factoids

factoid noun

fac·​toid ˈfak-ˌtȯid

1 : an invented fact believed to be true because it appears in print

2 : a briefly stated and usually trivial fact

## Statement

What the industry needs is an open-source high-performance Facts Record Journal with client interfaces that are not language specific. Yes, it would support hashtag#EventSourcing, and you could call it an hashtag#EventStore, but that's too limiting.
